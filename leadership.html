        <div class="expanded-body">
            <p>For the month of October, I partnered with Project Irreplaceable, a letter writing campaign created by a family whose mother was fighting breast cancer. This initiative helps students express their appreciation to special women in their lives—mothers, grandmothers, and mentors—while raising awareness about the importance of early detection and regular self-exams.</p>
            
            <p><strong>My Contribution:</strong></p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Set up a table during lunch where students could pick up letters or pink ribbons to show support.</li>
                <li>Actively encouraged student participation by sharing the impact of early detection.</li>
                <li>Created a meaningful, inclusive community event focused on health awareness and gratitude.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Personal Connection:</strong> My nana had breast cancer, and it was thanks to early detection that she was able to realize her condition and get treatment in time. This personal connection motivated my dedication to this campaign—early detection truly saves lives.</p>
            
            <p class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> This event reminded me of the power of community action and how engineering skills, combined with genuine care for others, can drive meaningful change both in our workplaces and in our lives.</p>
